EXERCISE 4

This week's exercise has made me realize that every weekly activity should be mastered by the students in order to prevent them from becoming disoriented by the current laboratory exercise, which will be used to delve deeper into the code's more detailed specifications and functionality. By ensuring that students have a strong foundation in each weekly activity, they will be better equipped to tackle more complex tasks and understand the intricacies of the code. This approach will ultimately lead to a more successful and productive learning experience for everyone involved.
